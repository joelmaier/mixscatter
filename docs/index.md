# Welcome to mixscatter

**mixscatter** is a versatile tool for calculating scattering 
functions of particle mixtures, particularly for [small-angle scattering (SAS)](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-angle_scattering)
and [dynamic light scattering (DLS)](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_light_scattering) applications.

## Key Features
* Scattering Functions: Calculate scattering amplitudes, measurable intensities, form factors,  
  structure factors and diffusion coefficients for multi-component mixtures.
* Flexible Mixture Composition: Define particle mixtures with arbitrary compositions and complex 
  scattering length density profiles.
* Advanced Models: Use predefined scattering models or build entirely custom particles with the 
  powerful `ParticleBuilder`.

## Background
Understanding the principles behind scattering techniques is crucial for interpreting experimental 
data accurately. **mixscatter** provides tools to analyze systems of interacting spherical 
scatterers in the Born approximation
([Rayleigh-Gans-Debye scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh-Gans_approximation)).
Very basic information and a couple of equations for the interested reader are given in the 
[Background](background.md) page of this documentation.
